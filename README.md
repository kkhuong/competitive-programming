# Competitive Programming
This repository contains all of the source code I have written to practice for competitve programming (especially the ACM ICPC) and CS internship interviews.

I intend to use this repository as a personal journal containing the details of my journey into competitive programming (including how I improve over time).

## Codes
Codes are written in `C++` whenever possible. We shall only use `Java` and ocasionally `Python` should it be easier to code a solution using those languages.

Codes here are written
* As quickly as possible to
* Just to get them to work (i.e., pass all test cases)
* Execute under the time/memory limit
* Are no longer updated once they received an *AC* verdict

Rewriting codes in this repository to adhere to the best software engineering practices is trivial. I strive to make use of the best practices whenever possible.

We will adhere to the practices described in [Competitive Programming 3](https://cpbook.net/).

## How to use this repository
Simply compile the `.cpp`, `.java` files individually. I do tend to use a lot of features that are introduced in `C++11` so to compile a `.cpp` file, I recommend using the command
```
g++ -std=c++0x <SOURCE FILE>
```

To compile a `.java` file, simply run the command
```
javac <SOURCE FILE>
```

Running executables (or bytecode) is the same as how you would normally do it. (:

## Misc
* Sometimes I would use `scanf/printf` and other times I would use `cin/cout`. This is depending on if I want to use partial Regex.
