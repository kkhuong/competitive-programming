# Competitive Programming
This repository contains all of the source code I have written to practice for competitve programming (especially the ACM ICPC) and CS internship interviews.

Code here are written as quickly as possible to
* Get them to work (i.e., pass all test cases)
* Execute under the time limit

Rewriting codes in this repository to adhere to the best software engineering practices is trivial.
